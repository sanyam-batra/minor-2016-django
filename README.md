# Minor-2016-Django

Project Name : Cardboard

Type : Web-App

A college's Sem-V Minor Project made by the efforts of me and my partner Kamaljeet Singh who have worked as a full stack developer.
The project is Django based using the HTML styling technologies with Ajax.
Cardboard's boards, lists, and cards enable you to organize and prioritize your projects in a fun, flexible and rewarding way.
